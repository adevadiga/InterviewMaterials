ReST: Representational State Transfer.
----
To create a resource on the server, use POST.
To retrieve a resource, use GET.
To change the state of a resource or to update it, use PUT.
To remove or delete a resource, use DELETE.

Get should not change the state of server - adding , modifying, deleting resource.
Post: payload  should be in the body of request.
Put: Replace the original resource.
