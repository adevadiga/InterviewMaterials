>Aspect: a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes.
>Join point: a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception. In Spring AOP, a join point always represents a method execution.
>Advice: action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Different types of advice include "around," "before" and "after" advice
>Pointcut: a predicate that matches join points. Advice is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut (for example, the execution of a method with a certain name).
