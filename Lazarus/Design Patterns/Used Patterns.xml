< Template Method Pattern >:
Defines a program skeleton of algorithm in a method, called template method,which defers some step to sub classes.
It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Ex: We have Rule based system, where based on certain properties certain different steps need to be taken.
Overall action taken remains same, that is structure of algorithm is same.

/* A template method : */
    public final void playOneGame(int playersCount) {
        this.playersCount = playersCount;
        initializeGame();
        int j = 0;
        while (!endOfGame()) {
            makePlay(j);
            j = (j + 1) % playersCount;
        }
        printWinner();
    }

	
< Adapter pattern>:
 Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
 It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
