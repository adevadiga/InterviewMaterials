 * Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
0 represents a car traveling east,
1 represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
1) Imagine array 0..N

(2) Take element X (iterate from 0 to Nth element)

(3) If value of element X is 1 then count how many 0 elements it has on left

(4) Repeat for next X
