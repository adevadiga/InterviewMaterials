 * Easy solution is add all numbers of second array to set.
 * Then try to add first array to same set. If the add operation was successful
 * it means that number not present in second array
 * 
 * Another option is to sort second array and do binary search for each element of first array.
 * Construct a BST and do a search. It will be same as above.
